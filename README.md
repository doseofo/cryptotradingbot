## Introduction 

A project to automatically run technical analysis strategies on AWS to trade cryptocurrencies whilst you sleep.

This project aims to have multiple trading strategies that can all be deployed into AWS using Terraform.

You can watch YouTube videos about the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee0JCfeFw1o&list=PLobCEGRAX3hZ0KqKoZ1RTlYZF-VguIhtC&index=4)

## How to Contribute 

Branch off from the project to create a new feature and open a PR against master when complete. 
Please feel free to reach out to me to check if a feature isn't already in development.
In the future I would love to see all sorts of strategies in this repo!
